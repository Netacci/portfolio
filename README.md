# portfolio

This site was built with Html, SASS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

I wanted to use Tailwind but the setup and documentaion was kinda complicated and I didn't have time to go into all that so I decided to use Sass and bootstrap.

I used this portfolio project to learn and practice Sass and hopefully with other projects I can get better.

I intend to add a dark mode feature later on but for now this would do.

The form validation hasn't been worked on, I intend using PHP to work on that much later.

Even though Bootstrap was used I didn't use a lot of their components, The navbar hamburger functionality was done with Javascript, I mostly used bootstrap utilities.

The slider was done using Slick slider and most of the icons are svg links from iconify.
