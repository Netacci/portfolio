This site was built with HTML, SASS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

This project was used to learn and practice SASS

I wanted to use Tailwind but the setup and documentaion was complicated since I wasn't using it on a framework and I didn't have time to go into all that so I decided to use SASS and bootstrap.

I intend to add a dark mode feature later on.

The form validation hasn't been worked on, I intend using PHP to work on that much later.

Even though Bootstrap was used I didn't use a lot of their components as I mostly used bootstrap utilities, The navbar hamburger functionality was done with Javascript.

The slider was done using Slick slider and most of the icons are svg links from iconify.

AOS was used for animation.
